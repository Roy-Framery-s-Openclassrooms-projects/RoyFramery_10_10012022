## Description
![Legend](./readMe/logo.png)

__*Learn@home*__ is the tenth project I made during this training. As a lead developer, I had a mission for the society "**Dev4U**". The goal 🎯 was to manage the development of a project. 

For this purpose, I had some task to realyse before the next meeting with the client :
- Use case diagrams for each of the major features of each page (login, chat, calendar, task manager, dashboard)
- User stories with acceptance criteria for each feature, shared in a standard format (PDF, DOCX, XLSX).
- Mock-ups with a simple design and at least one mock-up per page (you can use Figma or Sketch).
- A Kanban breaking down the project, in a macro way (excluding technical details) into blocks of features and sub-features for development. 

Moreover, I had at my disposal a [document](./readMe/synthesis_expectations_customer.pdf) synthesizing the expectations of the customer about features and mock-ups (wireframes).

## Mock-ups

I realised mock-ups with [figma](https://www.figma.com/). The goal was to present the integration of the wireframes with the features by using logo as a starting point for the visual identity. So I realised a [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/file/WhjGhVBIYMxKFJiZzECTzT/Maquette-Learn%40Home?node-id=7%3A21) and a [Mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/WhjGhVBIYMxKFJiZzECTzT/Maquette-Learn%40Home?node-id=53%3A771) version of this project.

## Kanban
To set up the tasks to integrate the different features, I used [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
